//Problem Statement: 
//Given an array of N + 1 size, where each element is between 1 and N. 
//Assuming there is only one duplicate number, your task is to find the duplicate number.
//Input: arr=[1,3,4,2,2]
//Output: 2
//Input: [3,1,3,4,2]
//Output:3

//Solution 2:Using frequency array
//Approach: Take a frequency array of size N+1 and initialize it to 0.
//Now traverse through the array and if the frequency of the element is 0 increase it by 1,
//else if the frequency is not 0 then that element is the required answer.
