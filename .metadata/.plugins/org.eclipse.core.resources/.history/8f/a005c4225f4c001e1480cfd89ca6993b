//Algorithm:
//First, we’ll start the traversal from the right. Then, we move toward the left. 
//Whenever we encounter a new element, we check with the greatest element obtained so far.
//If the current element is greater than the greatest so far, 
//then the current element is one of the leaders and we update the greatest element
//Else, we proceed with the further elements on the left.
//This method prints the leaders in the reverse direction of their occurrences.
